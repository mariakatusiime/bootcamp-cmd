## Agile Group Project - Bootcamp Ratings Command Line Application

Users:
Users come in 3 roles. Bootcampers, LFAs and LFs. 
Bootcampers are scored daily on all our EPIC values based on their outputs and observed interactions with their teams. The scores ranges between -2 to 2 i.e (Very Unsatisfied, Unsatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied and Very Satisfied)
LFs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates in Bootcamp. They however can’t change any of the scores and neither can they add scores.
LFAs have the ability to see scores for all the candidates that are assigned to them during Bootcamp, add scores for them and edit only their candidate’s scores.
Bootcampers can only see the scores they have been given. 

Note
Users
Users can be logged in and out.
When logging in, set the last_seen timestamp. Don’t modify this timestamp when logging out. 
Reports
LFs should be able to see which candidates are performing well and those who can’t. They should also be able to see which candidates haven’t been scored yet for a given day.
